    "# Unify and clean-up intersections of divided roads\n",
    "\n",
    "Divided roads are represented by separate centerline edges. The intersection of two divided roads thus creates 4 nodes, representing where each edge intersects a perpendicular edge. These 4 nodes represent a single intersection in the real world. Roundabouts similarly create a cluster of intersections where each edge connects to the roundabout. This function cleans up these clusters by buffering their points to an arbitrary distance, merging overlapping buffers, and returning a GeoSeries of their centroids. For best results, the tolerance argument should be adjusted to approximately match street design standards in the specific street network.\n",
